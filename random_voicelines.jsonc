/*
This document stores the IDs of the random voice lines heard throughout the episode. Some random lines are stored elsewhere, mostly because they don't display any subtitles. Individual episodes or questions may choose to override these.
The "v" key is the file name of the voice line minus the file extension.
The "s" key is the subtitle text of the voice line.
NOTE: Godot allows JSON files to have trailing commas, but not comments. I coded in a simple comment removal function in Loader.gd.
